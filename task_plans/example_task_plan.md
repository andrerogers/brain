# Comprehensive Task Plan

## Task Information
- **Task ID:** EXAMPLE-001
- **Task Name:** Implement User Authentication System
- **Priority:** High
- **Deadline:** 2023-06-30

## User Intent
Develop a secure authentication system that allows users to register, log in, reset passwords, and manage their profiles. The system should support both email/password and social media authentication options.

## Objectives
- Create a secure, scalable authentication system
- Support multiple authentication methods (email/password, Google, GitHub)
- Implement password recovery and account management features
- Ensure GDPR compliance for user data handling

## Deliverables
- User registration and login API endpoints
- Password reset functionality
- Social authentication integration
- User profile management interface
- Authentication middleware for protected routes
- Comprehensive test suite

## Execution Steps
1. Design authentication data models and database schema
   - Tools: Database modeling tools, SQL/NoSQL database
   - Expected outcome: Finalized database schema
   - Estimated time: 1 day

2. Implement core authentication services
   - Tools: Backend framework (Node.js/Express), JWT library
   - Expected outcome: Working authentication service with API endpoints
   - Estimated time: 3 days

3. Develop password reset and account recovery features
   - Tools: Email service integration, token generation library
   - Expected outcome: Functional password reset flow
   - Estimated time: 2 days

4. Integrate social authentication providers
   - Tools: OAuth libraries, provider SDKs
   - Expected outcome: Working social login options
   - Estimated time: 2 days

5. Create user profile management interface
   - Tools: Frontend framework (React/Vue), form validation libraries
   - Expected outcome: User profile CRUD operations
   - Estimated time: 2 days

6. Implement authentication middleware
   - Tools: Backend framework middleware system
   - Expected outcome: Route protection based on authentication
   - Estimated time: 1 day

7. Write comprehensive tests
   - Tools: Testing framework, mocking libraries
   - Expected outcome: >90% test coverage
   - Estimated time: 2 days

## Dependencies
- Database system setup and configuration
- External authentication provider API keys (Google, GitHub)
- Email service configuration for password resets
- Frontend environment for user interface components

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk 1:** Security vulnerabilities in authentication implementation
  - Mitigation: Follow OWASP security best practices, conduct security audit

- **Risk 2:** Rate limiting and brute force protection
  - Mitigation: Implement proper rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms

- **Risk 3:** Social authentication provider API changes
  - Mitigation: Use established libraries, monitor for deprecation notices

## Success Criteria
- All authentication flows work correctly and securely
- System passes security audit and penetration testing
- User data is properly protected and GDPR compliant
- Authentication system handles high load and edge cases

## Resources Required
- Access to production database systems
- Development environment with necessary dependencies
- API keys for third-party authentication providers
- Testing environment that mimics production

## Notes
This system will be the foundation for all user-related features in the application. Special attention should be paid to security best practices and scalability considerations.
