# Product Requirements Document: Brain Agentic Framework

**Author:** Andre Rogers
**Date:** July 8, 2025
**Version:** 1.3

## 1. Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the vision, scope, and functional requirements for the Brain Agentic Framework. It serves as a foundational document for guiding the development process, ensuring alignment among all stakeholders, and providing a clear understanding of the product to be built.

## 2. Problem Statement

Developers often face challenges in managing information overload, staying focused amidst distractions, and efficiently leveraging vast amounts of knowledge during their daily tasks. Traditional IDEs and development tools, while powerful, are largely reactive, requiring explicit commands or manual navigation to access information or perform complex operations. This leads to context switching, reduced productivity, and missed opportunities for proactive assistance.

## 3. Goals

The primary goal of the Brain Agentic Framework is to create an intelligent, proactive, and context-aware development assistant that seamlessly integrates into the developer's editor. This assistant will:

*   **Enhance Developer Productivity:** By minimizing context switching and providing relevant information and assistance proactively.
*   **Improve Code Quality:** Through real-time feedback, automated test generation, and intelligent suggestions.
*   **Accelerate Learning and Knowledge Retention:** By intelligently organizing and retrieving project-specific and general programming knowledge.
*   **Provide a Personalized Experience:** Adapting to individual developer workflows, preferences, and project contexts.
*   **Be Extensible and Modular:** Allowing for easy integration with new tools, agents, and editors.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Editor Integration

*   **Seamless Integration:** The framework shall integrate seamlessly with popular text editors (e.g., NeoVim) as a plugin, providing a native user experience.
*   **Context Extraction:** The plugin shall continuously extract comprehensive context from the editor environment, including buffer content, cursor position, file paths, and project metadata.
*   **Response Display:** The plugin shall display responses from the Brain Core in a non-intrusive and contextual manner, such as inline suggestions, diagnostic messages, and dedicated output panels.

### 4.2. Intelligent Triggering

*   **Proactive Assistance:** The system shall proactively offer assistance based on intelligent triggers, without requiring explicit user commands.
*   **Configurable Triggers:** Users shall be able to configure trigger thresholds, including buffer capacity, idle time, and manual invocation.
*   **Efficiency Mechanisms:** The system shall employ debouncing, cooldowns, and dirty flags/diffing to optimize communication and prevent over-triggering.

### 4.3. Real-time Unit Test Generation

*   **Dedicated Test Buffer:** The editor plugin shall manage a dedicated buffer or pane for displaying auto-generated unit tests.
*   **Contextual Test Generation:** The Brain Core shall analyze code context and generate corresponding unit tests in real-time.
*   **Real-time Updates:** Generated unit tests shall update dynamically as the user modifies code.
*   **Language Support:** Initial support for common programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) and their unit testing frameworks.

### 4.4. Hierarchical Memory System

*   **Memory Bank (Long-Term):** The system shall maintain a persistent store for long-term project knowledge, key insights, and **knowledge objects**.
*   **Local Index (Short-Term):** The system shall utilize a fast, in-memory or local store for recent context and current session data.
*   **Knowledge Graph (External Service):** The system shall integrate with an external Knowledge Graph service to store structured relationships between entities and **knowledge objects**.
    *   **Knowledge Objects:** These are structured facts derived from the **Activity Stream** and **artifacts**. They replace the concept of summaries.
    *   **Interactions:** These are granular, timestamped records of any significant user action or system observation. They make up an **Activity Stream**.
    *   **Activity Stream:** This is a continuous, multi-modal flow composed of discrete **Interaction Events** and **Contextual States**. It replaces the concept of conversations.
    *   **Semantic Representations:** These are embeddings created from **artifacts** (media specified by the user) or **knowledge objects**. At the end of the day or when specified, these semantic representations are inserted into the KG. Semantic representations that are the embeddings for the day's activity should be condensed from multiple knowledge objects from the day.
    *   **KG Updates:** The KG can be updated by the user via explicit commands and will also update automatically every 24 hours or on startup via a configurable cron job.

### 4.5. Tool Integrations

*   **LLM Integration:** The framework shall integrate with various Large Language Models (LLMs) for natural language understanding, generation, and code-related tasks.
*   **MCP Servers:** Integration with Multi-Component Protocol (MCP) servers for filesystem operations, Git commands, codebase analysis, and other development tools.
*   **External Services:** Ability to integrate with other external services (e.g., search engines, external APIs) as needed.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** The system shall provide real-time or near real-time responses to user interactions and proactive triggers.
*   **Reliability:** The system shall be robust and resilient, handling errors gracefully and ensuring data integrity.
*   **Scalability:** The architecture shall support future expansion in terms of features, agents, and integrated tools.
*   **Security:** The system shall adhere to best practices for data security and privacy.
*   **Usability:** The editor integration shall be intuitive and non-intrusive, enhancing the developer workflow.
*   **Configurability:** Users shall be able to customize various aspects of the system, including trigger thresholds, response display, and memory management settings.

## 6. User Stories

This section outlines key user stories that describe the desired functionality from the perspective of a developer using the Brain Agentic Framework.

*   **As a developer, I want the Brain to automatically generate unit tests for the code I'm writing, so I can quickly verify my changes.**
*   **As a developer, I want the Brain to suggest relevant code snippets or documentation based on my current context, so I don't have to break my flow to search.**
*   **As a developer, I want the Brain to highlight potential issues or improvements in my code as I type, so I can fix them early.**
*   **As a developer, I want the Brain to remember my project-specific knowledge and preferences, so it can provide more personalized assistance over time.**
*   **As a developer, I want to be able to explicitly tell the Brain to update its knowledge graph with specific information, so I can ensure important details are captured.**
*   **As a developer, I want the Brain to proactively offer to summarize a complex code section I'm reviewing, so I can quickly grasp its purpose.**

## 7. Assumptions and Constraints

*   **Primary User:** Individual developers using text editors (initially NeoVim).
*   **Internet Connectivity:** Assumed for access to LLMs and external services.
*   **Local Execution:** Brain Core will primarily run locally on the user's machine.
*   **Initial Focus:** The initial MVP will focus on core functionality and a single editor integration.

## 8. Future Enhancements

This section outlines potential future features and improvements for the Brain Agentic Framework.

*   **Multi-Editor Support:** Expanding integration to other popular editors (e.g., VS Code, Emacs).
*   **Advanced Memory Systems:** Implementing more sophisticated long-term memory capabilities, building upon the core hierarchical memory and dual embedding system.
*   **Collaborative Features:** Support for team-based knowledge sharing and collaborative development assistance.
*   **Personalized Learning:** Deeper adaptation to individual developer learning styles and habits.
*   **Expanded Tool Integrations:** Integrating with a wider array of development tools and services.
