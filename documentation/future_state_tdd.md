*   **Editor Plugin (e.g., NeoVim):** The user-facing component residing within the developer's editor. It extracts context, triggers Brain Core actions, and displays responses.
*   **Driver (TS/JS Bridge):** A lightweight intermediary responsible for establishing and maintaining communication between the Editor Plugin and the Brain Core. It handles message framing and process management.
*   **Brain Core (Agent Engine):** The intelligent backend that processes context, orchestrates agents, integrates with external tools, and manages the system's memory.

### 2.2. Brain Core System Architecture

The Brain Core is the heart of the system, responsible for processing context, orchestrating agents, and interacting with various external services and tools.

#### 2.2.1. Execution Flow

The Brain Core operates through a series of interconnected modules, ensuring a streamlined flow from context ingestion to response generation:

1.  **Context Ingestion:** The Brain Core receives contextual data from the Driver, which originates from the Editor Plugin. This data includes buffer content, cursor position, file paths, and other relevant editor states.
2.  **Context Processing:** The incoming context is analyzed to identify user intent, relevant entities, and potential areas for assistance. This involves initial parsing and semantic analysis.
3.  **Agent Orchestration:** Based on the processed context and inferred intent, the Agent Orchestrator (`agent/workflow.py`) determines which specialized agents (e.g., Planning Agent, Execution Agent) need to be invoked. It manages the lifecycle and coordination of these agents.
4.  **Tool Integration:** Agents interact with external tools (e.g., LLM APIs, MCP Servers) through a standardized Tool Infrastructure Layer. This layer handles tool discovery, access, and validation.
5.  **Memory Management:** Throughout the process, agents interact with the Hierarchical Memory System to retrieve past knowledge, store new insights, and maintain context across interactions.
6.  **Response Generation:** Once an agent completes its task, the Brain Core formulates a structured response, which is then sent back to the Driver for display in the Editor Plugin.

#### 2.2.3. Proactive Agent Architecture (Current Goal)

This section outlines the architectural vision for the Brain Agentic Framework to function as a proactive agent that lives within your favorite editor, providing real-time, intelligent assistance without explicit user commands. This is a **current goal** for the project, not a future enhancement. The key addition is the integration of intelligent triggering mechanisms within the Editor Plugin and a more dynamic interaction model with the Brain Core.

**Description of Proactive Agent State:**

In its current goal state, the Brain Agentic Framework will seamlessly integrate into the developer's workflow, proactively offering assistance. This involves enhancing the Editor Plugin with intelligent triggering and refining the Brain Core to handle these proactive requests.

1.  **Editor Plugin (e.g., NeoVim):**
    *   **Context Extractor (CE):** Continues to gather comprehensive context from the editor (buffer content, cursor position, file type, etc.).
    *   **Intelligent Triggering (IT):** This is a critical component. Instead of relying solely on explicit user commands, the plugin will use advanced heuristics to determine when to send context to the Brain Core. This includes:
        *   **Debouncing:** Prevents excessive requests during rapid typing by waiting for a brief pause in activity.
        *   **Cooldown:** Enforces a short period after a request is sent during which automatic triggers are suppressed, preventing over-triggering.
        *   **Dirty Flags/Diffing:** Tracks changes to the buffer and only triggers a send when significant modifications or a certain amount of accumulated changes are detected, optimizing communication.
    *   **Test Buffer Manager (TBM):** A new component responsible for managing a dedicated scratch buffer or pane within the editor where real-time generated unit tests will be displayed. It handles opening, updating, and synchronizing this buffer with the main code.
    *   **Response Display (RD):** Enhanced to handle various types of proactive responses, including real-time unit tests, inline suggestions, and contextual diagnostics.

2.  **Bridge (Driver - TS/JS Bridge):** Remains the robust intermediary, but its role in managing message flow becomes even more critical with increased frequency of communication.
    *   **Message Framing (MF):** Continues to ensure reliable communication over `stdio` using the `Content-Length` protocol.
    *   **Process Manager (PM):** Manages the Brain Core's lifecycle.
    *   `Message Queues`: Explicit internal queues will be crucial here to handle the potentially higher volume of messages from intelligent triggers, ensuring smooth flow, decoupling, and backpressure management.

3.  **Brain Core (Agent Engine):** Evolves to process and respond to the proactive context updates.
    *   **Context Processor (CP):** Analyzes the incoming context, potentially inferring user intent or identifying areas requiring assistance.
    *   **Agent Orchestrator (AO):** Becomes more dynamic, deciding which specialized agents to invoke based on the proactive triggers. This includes invoking the new Test Generation Agent.
    *   **Tool Integration (TI):** Continues to provide access to LLMs and MCP Servers, but with an emphasis on low-latency responses for proactive features.
    *   **Memory Management (MM):** Becomes even more critical for maintaining context across proactive interactions, learning from past suggestions, and storing user preferences for personalized assistance.

4.  **External Systems:** Continue to be integrated, with LLMs playing a central role in generating intelligent content (like unit tests) and MCP Servers providing access to various development tools.

**Flow of Proactive Interaction:**

1.  Developer types code in the Editor Plugin.
2.  **Context Extractor (CE)** continuously monitors the buffer.
3.  **Intelligent Triggering (IT)**, based on debouncing, cooldowns, and dirty flags, determines when to send a `Context Update` to the **Driver**.
4.  The **Driver** receives the update, frames it, and sends a `Request` to the **Brain Core**.
5.  The **Brain Core** receives the request, and the **Context Processor (CP)** analyzes it.
6.  The **Agent Orchestrator (AO)**, recognizing the need for proactive assistance (e.g., unit test generation), invokes the **Test Generation Agent (TGA)**.
7.  The **Test Generation Agent (TGA)** uses **Tool Integration (TI)** to interact with **LLMs** and potentially **MCP Servers** to generate unit tests.
8.  The **Brain Core** sends the `Generated Tests/Suggestions` back to the **Driver**.
9.  The **Driver** receives the response, unframes it, and sends a `Display Update` to the **Editor Plugin**.
10. The **Response Display (RD)** component in the plugin receives the update, and the **Test Buffer Manager (TBM)** updates the dedicated test buffer with the new unit tests, providing real-time feedback to the developer.

## 3. Editor Plugin (NeoVim)

The Editor Plugin serves as the primary interface between the user and the Brain Core. It is responsible for extracting context, intelligently triggering Brain Core actions, and displaying responses within the editor environment.

### 3.1. Context Extraction

The Context Extractor component continuously monitors the editor environment to gather relevant information, including:

*   **Buffer Content:** The full text content of the active buffer.
*   **Cursor Position and Selection:** The current location of the cursor and any selected text.
*   **File Path and Type:** The absolute path and file extension of the currently open file.
*   **Project-Specific Metadata:** Information from project configuration files (e.g., `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`) or version control systems (e.g., Git branch, commit history).

### 3.2. Intelligent Triggering

This component determines when to send contextual information to the Brain Core. It employs advanced heuristics to balance responsiveness with resource efficiency:

*   **Buffer Capacity Trigger:** Sends context when the buffer content changes by a certain amount (e.g., every 50 characters typed, or every 10 lines added). This prevents sending a request for every single keystroke.
*   **Idle Time Trigger:** Sends context after a period of user inactivity (e.g., 2 seconds of no typing). This allows Brain to process the user's thoughts after a pause.
*   **Manual Trigger:** Users can explicitly invoke Brain via editor commands (e.g., `:BrainSuggest`, `:BrainSummarize`) for on-demand assistance.
*   **Debouncing:** Prevents excessive requests during rapid typing by waiting for a brief pause in activity before sending the context.
*   **Cooldown:** Enforces a short period after a request is sent during which automatic triggers are suppressed, preventing over-triggering and system overload.
*   **Dirty Flags/Diffing:** Tracks changes to the buffer and only triggers a send when significant modifications or a certain amount of accumulated changes are detected, optimizing communication by avoiding redundant context transfers.

### 3.3. Response Display

Responses from the Brain Core are displayed within the editor in a non-intrusive and contextual manner:

*   **Inline Suggestions:** Displayed directly within the code or text, similar to IDE auto-completion or linting suggestions.
*   **Diagnostic Messages:** Warnings, errors, or informational messages presented in the editor's diagnostic area.
*   **Dedicated Output Panels:** For longer responses or summaries, a separate editor pane or floating window can be used.

### 3.4. Configuration

The Editor Plugin will provide configurable options for users to customize its behavior, including:

*   Trigger thresholds (e.g., idle time duration, buffer change size).
*   Response display preferences (e.g., inline vs. panel).
*   Brain Core connection settings (e.g., host, port).

### 3.5. Real-time Unit Test Generation

This feature provides developers with immediate, context-aware unit test generation directly within their editor environment.

*   **Test Buffer Management:** The editor plugin will be able to open and manage a dedicated buffer or pane (e.g., on the right side of the current code buffer) specifically for displaying auto-generated unit tests. It handles opening, updating, and synchronizing this buffer with the main code.
*   **Contextual Test Generation:** The Brain Core, upon receiving code context from the editor, will analyze the code (e.g., function definitions, class structures) and generate corresponding unit tests.
*   **Real-time Updates:** As the user writes or modifies code in the main buffer, the Brain Core will continuously update the generated unit tests in the dedicated test buffer to reflect the latest code changes.
*   **Language Support:** Initial support will focus on common programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) for which robust unit testing frameworks exist.
*   **Configurable Behavior:** Users will be able to enable/disable this feature, configure the test generation frequency, and specify test framework preferences.

## 4. Driver (TS/JS Bridge)

The Driver acts as a robust intermediary, mediating communication between the Editor Plugins and the Brain Core. It is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and reliable.

### 4.1. Communication Protocol

The Driver implements a standardized, bidirectional communication protocol, inspired by the Language Server Protocol (LSP), to ensure reliable and efficient data exchange. This typically involves:

*   **JSON-RPC:** For structured requests and responses.
*   **`stdio` (Standard I/O):** As the primary transport mechanism, allowing for easy inter-process communication.
*   **Message Framing:** A critical component that ensures messages are correctly delimited and parsed. This is achieved using a `Content-Length` header, where each message is prefixed with its byte length, allowing the receiver to know exactly how many bytes to read for a complete message. This prevents partial reads or concatenation of multiple messages.

### 4.2. Process Management

The Driver is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the Brain Core process. This includes:

*   **Spawning:** Starting the Brain Core process when the editor plugin is initialized.
*   **Monitoring:** Keeping track of the Brain Core's health and status.
*   **Termination:** Gracefully shutting down the Brain Core process when the editor is closed or the plugin is disabled.

### 4.3. Bidirectional Communication

Supports seamless two-way communication:

*   **Plugin to Brain Core:** Sending context updates, manual commands, and other requests.
*   **Brain Core to Plugin:** Receiving responses, proactive suggestions, and notifications.

### 4.4. Error Handling

Robust error handling mechanisms are in place to ensure system stability:

*   Gracefully handling communication errors (e.g., broken pipes, network issues).
*   Detecting and recovering from Brain Core process crashes.
*   Handling malformed messages or unexpected data formats.

### 4.5. Message Queues

Explicit internal message queues within the Driver are crucial for handling the potentially higher volume of messages from intelligent triggers. These queues ensure:

*   **Smooth Flow:** Decoupling the sender and receiver, allowing them to operate at different paces.
*   **Backpressure Management:** Preventing the sender from overwhelming the receiver by buffering messages.
*   **Reliability:** Ensuring messages are not lost during temporary disconnections or processing delays.

## 5. Brain Core (Agent Engine)

The Brain Core is the intelligent backend of the framework, written in Python. It processes incoming context, orchestrates various agents, manages memory, and integrates with external tools to provide intelligent assistance.

### 5.1. Context Processor

Analyzes the incoming contextual data from the Driver. This involves:

*   **Parsing:** Extracting structured information from raw text (e.g., code syntax, natural language sentences).
*   **Intent Inference:** Determining the user's likely goal or need based on the context and recent activity.
*   **Relevance Filtering:** Identifying the most pertinent parts of the context for further processing.

### 5.2. Agent Coordination

(`agent/engine.py`) Manages the creation, lifecycle, and coordination of agents. It acts as the central hub for agent activities.

### 5.3. Multi-Agent Orchestrator

(`agent/workflow.py`) Orchestrates the execution of multiple specialized agents based on the processed context and inferred intent. It defines and manages workflows, ensuring agents collaborate effectively to achieve complex tasks.

### 5.4. Tool Integration

Provides a standardized mechanism for agents to interact with external tools and services. This includes:

*   **Large Language Model (LLM) APIs:** Integration with services like OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, etc., for natural language understanding and generation, code generation, and more.
*   **Search Engines:** Ability to perform contextual web searches to retrieve relevant information.
*   **Local Knowledge Bases:** Integration with note-taking applications (e.g., Obsidian) or local documentation for context-aware retrieval.
*   **MCP Servers:** Interaction with various Multi-Component Protocol (MCP) servers for filesystem operations, Git commands, codebase analysis, dev tools, and more.

### 5.5. Specialized Agents

The Brain Core will leverage various specialized agents, each designed for specific tasks:

*   **Planning Agent:** Responsible for breaking down complex user requests or inferred intents into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.
*   **Orchestrator Agent:** Coordinates the execution of sub-tasks and manages the flow between different agents.
*   **Execution Agent:** Executes specific actions, often by invoking external tools via the Tool Integration layer.
*   **Test Generation Agent:** A specialized agent responsible for generating unit tests based on code context, as part of the Real-time Unit Test Generation feature.

### 5.6. Memory Management

Memory management is critical for Brain's ability to provide intelligent, context-aware assistance over time. It enables the system to learn from past interactions, store user preferences, and maintain project-specific knowledge. The `agent/memory.py` component will house this system.

*   **Hierarchical Memory System:**
    *   **Memory Bank (Long-Term):** A persistent store for knowledge objects, key insights, and long-term project memory (e.g., using vector databases like Pinecone, Weaviate). Data is promoted here from the Local Index based on criteria like importance, frequency of access, or explicit user action.
    *   **Local Index (Short-Term):** A fast, in-memory or local store for recent context, current session data, and frequently accessed information (e.g., using Chroma, FAISS). This allows for low-latency retrieval of immediate context.
    *   **Note:** The detailed flow for how different sections of memory will be utilized by `pydantic-ai` agents (e.g., how they specifically leverage the KG for contextual understanding, planning, response generation, and storing insights) needs to be designed in a future iteration. This section will be fleshed out later.

*   **Knowledge Graph (External Service):**
    *   An external service (e.g., Neo4j) that stores structured relationships between entities and knowledge objects. It is accessed by agents to retrieve and store structured facts, aiding in query analysis, task decomposition, and tool selection.
    *   **Not an MCP Server Tool:** The Knowledge Graph service will not be an MCP server tool. Instead, it will be an external service that `pydantic-ai` agents interact with directly.
    *   **Data Source:** The Knowledge Graph service will keep an up-to-date version of the results of the dual embedding services.
    *   **Updates:**
        *   **User-Triggered:** It can be updated by the user via explicit commands (e.g., `:BrainKGUpdate <parameters>`). These commands could allow specifying `update_current_buffer`, `update_project_files`, `update_selected_text`, or a `path/to/file`.
        *   **Automated Cron Job:** It will also update automatically every 24 hours or on startup. This cron job should be configurable (e.g., time, types of data to update, specific project scopes).
        *   New information will be queued for post-interaction processing.
    *   **Conflict Resolution:** Conflicts in the Knowledge Graph will be resolved over time by way of user feedback, implying a mechanism to detect conflicts, flag them for user review, present choices, and update scores based on user input.

*   **Dual Embedding System:** Utilizes specialized embedding models for different data types to optimize retrieval accuracy.
    *   **Activity Stream Embeddings:** Generated for interaction events (e.g., user actions, system observations) that make up the activity stream. These embeddings are optimized for capturing dynamic context and user intent. Routing logic: If the media type is a series of interaction events, it will be routed to the activity stream embedding model.
    *   **Artifact Embeddings:** Generated for non-activity stream data such as documents, code files, and multimedia. These embeddings are optimized for structural, functional, or visual characteristics. Routing logic: If the media type is a project or a group of files, it will be routed to the artifact embedding model. User confirmation will be required to ensure artifacts are included in the Knowledge Graph or not, giving the user control over what persistent knowledge is stored.

### 5.7. `pydantic-ai` Agent Interaction with Memory and KG

Agents created by the `agent engine` will be built with `pydantic-ai`. These agents will have inherent definitions that allow them to interact deeply with the memory system and Knowledge Graph:

*   **Semantic Representations:** Agents will interact with semantic representations (embeddings) for performing relevant retrieval from both the Local Index and Memory Bank.
*   **Artifact Representation Creation:** Agents will be capable of creating representations of artifacts such as media specified by the user, which will then be processed by the Dual Embedding System.
*   **Knowledge Objects Access:** Agents will have direct access to knowledge objects (structured facts derived from the Activity Stream and artifacts).
*   **Knowledge Graph Querying:** Agents will have access to query the Knowledge Graph. They will use the **Activity Stream** as context to intelligently query the KG. This means that if the query is about the user, the user's activities, or the project, the agent will query the KG. The system will intelligently figure out if the subject or subjects in the current activity solicit the KG.

### 5.8. Detailed Execution Flows

#### 5.8.1. Command Execution Flow

1.  **User Input:** A user initiates a command (e.g., via editor plugin, CLI) or performs an action that triggers a context update.
2.  **Editor Plugin:** Captures the context (buffer content, cursor, file, etc.) and sends it to the Driver.
3.  **Driver:** Receives the context, frames the message, and sends it to the Brain Core via WebSocket.
4.  **`server.py`:** Receives the WebSocket message and passes it to `app/handler.py`.
5.  **`app/handler.py`:** Routes the command/context to the appropriate internal handlers.
6.  **`app/context_processor.py`:** Processes the raw context, extracts relevant information, and infers initial intent.

10. **Agent Execution:** The selected agents perform their tasks, interacting with `agent/memory.py` for memory access and `app/tool_bridge.py` for tool access.
11. **Tool Interaction:** Agents use `app/tool_bridge.py` -> `app/tool_adapters.py` -> `tools/client.py` to interact with MCP Servers (Filesystem, Git, Codebase, DevTools, Exa) or other external tools (LLMs).
12. **Response Generation:** Agents generate a response based on their task completion.
13. **`app/streaming.py`:** Sends real-time updates or final responses back through `server.py`.
14. **`server.py`:** Sends the response back to the Driver via WebSocket.
15. **Driver:** Receives the response, unframes it, and passes it to the Editor Plugin.
16. **Editor Plugin:** Displays the response to the user.

#### 5.8.2. Proactive Trigger Flow

1.  **User Activity:** User types, pauses, or makes significant changes in the editor.
2.  **Editor Plugin (Context Extractor):** Monitors activity.
3.  **Editor Plugin (Intelligent Triggering):** Applies debouncing, cooldowns, and dirty flags to determine if a `Context Update` should be sent.
4.  **Driver:** Receives the `Context Update`, frames it, and sends it to the Brain Core.
5.  **Brain Core (Context Processor):** Analyzes the incoming context, identifies patterns for proactive assistance.
6.  **Brain Core (Agent Orchestrator):** Decides which agents to invoke for proactive tasks (e.g., Test Generation Agent, Suggestion Agent).
7.  **Agent Execution:** Proactive agents perform their tasks, leveraging memory and tools.
8.  **Brain Core:** Sends proactive suggestions/updates back to the Driver.
9.  **Editor Plugin (Response Display/Test Buffer Manager):** Displays the proactive output (e.g., real-time unit tests, inline suggestions).

### 5.9. Key Design Patterns

*   **Layered Architecture:** Clear separation of concerns into distinct layers (Editor Plugin, Driver, Application, Agent Engine, Tool Infrastructure, MCP Servers).
*   **Observer Pattern:** Editor Plugin observes user activity and triggers context updates.
*   **Mediator Pattern:** The Driver acts as a mediator between the Editor Plugin and Brain Core.
*   **Agent-Based System:** Utilizes autonomous agents for specialized tasks, promoting modularity and extensibility.
*   **Message Queues:** Decouples components and handles asynchronous communication, improving responsiveness and fault tolerance.
*   **Dependency Injection:** For managing dependencies between modules and facilitating testing.

### 5.10. Performance Considerations

*   **Low-Latency IPC:** Prioritizing `stdio` with message framing for minimal overhead between Driver and Brain Core.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Utilizing asynchronous programming (e.g., `asyncio` in Python) within the Brain Core to handle multiple requests concurrently.
*   **Efficient Context Diffing:** Minimizing data transfer by sending only changes (diffs) rather than full buffer content when possible.
*   **Optimized Embedding Lookups:** Efficient indexing and querying of vector databases for fast memory retrieval.

### 5.11. Observability

*   **Structured Logging:** Implementing comprehensive, structured logging across all components to facilitate debugging and monitoring.
*   **Metrics Collection:** Gathering key performance metrics (e.g., latency, throughput, error rates) for system health monitoring.
*   **Tracing:** Implementing distributed tracing to track requests across different components and identify performance bottlenecks.

### 5.12. Security Considerations

*   **Data Sanitization:** All incoming user data will be sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
*   **Least Privilege:** Components will operate with the minimum necessary permissions.
*   **Secure Communication:** Encrypted communication channels (e.g., WSS for WebSockets) will be used where sensitive data is transmitted.
*   **Input Validation:** Strict validation of all inputs to prevent malformed data from causing issues.

### 5.13. Validation and Testing

*   **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive unit tests for individual modules and functions.
*   **Integration Tests:** Testing the interaction between different components (e.g., Driver and Brain Core, agents and tools).
*   **End-to-End Tests:** Simulating full user workflows from editor input to response display.
*   **Performance Tests:** Benchmarking key operations to ensure performance requirements are met.

### 5.14. Configuration Management

*   **Centralized Configuration:** A single, easily manageable configuration system for all Brain Core parameters.
*   **Environment Variables:** Support for environment variables to override configuration for deployment flexibility.
*   **User-Specific Settings:** Mechanisms for users to customize behavior via editor plugin settings, which are then passed to the Brain Core.

### 5.15. Deployment Strategy

*   **Containerization:** Packaging Brain Core and its dependencies into Docker containers for consistent deployment across environments.
*   **Local Deployment:** Primary deployment model will be local execution on the user's machine.
*   **Background Service:** Option to run Brain Core as a persistent background service.
